"""Standalone bridge smoke: connect + SPX subscription against paper (TWS 7497).

Throwaway — full end-to-end is finalized in Task 17 (server.py wiring). This
smokes the native IBClient + ported ib_connection entry points directly.

Run:  python tests/spikes/smoke_bridge.py
Requires: TWS/paper running on 127.0.0.1:7497 (default IB_CLIENT_ID).
